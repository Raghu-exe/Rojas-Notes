1. Self announcement

    People need to know who you are in the first place. This in turn will avail you to donations form supporters and backers. Publicity will get you news coverage and also people will begin to form an opinion about you. The location and time of your self announcement is also important; Barack Obama in 2008; Donald Trump in 2015; Kamala Harris in 2019-

2. Winning the party primary election

    You are competing against other candidates to represent your political party. You are trying to obtain votes from the party representatives. These members of the party are extreme in their beliefs of the party, and will likely to support the candidate that is also very binding  in their views. The campaign for the primary can hinder you in the general election;

3. National Convention and Winning VeeP

    The VP candidate can be a voice for a group of people that the candidate may not be reaching out to; also the VP is only a 

    *Example: Camilla Harris as she is a woman and African American so she appeals to both of those groups*

4. Campaign only in the swing states, not across United States!!! These states are: 

    Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin

    Swing states are states that sway between Republican and Democrats

5. Presidential Debates

    There are 3 debates between the two presidential candidates, and 1  between the two vice president candidates. The debates are coordinated by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), and they are usually fair and balanced. FUN FACT: The debates are really pointless, because at this point most voters, have already decided who they will vote for President. They are tradition.

6. Election Day

    General elections - Falls on Tuesday after the first Monday in November . Here the people are voting for the electors of the political parties , which will then vote in the electoral college for the candidate. The popular vote does not elect the president; instead it is (and always has been) the electoral college. (Had the popular vote been considered, we would have Al Gor as President in 2000 and Hillary Rodham Clinton as President in 2016 ) Why does the popular vote not count?

7. Electoral College

    Electoral college convenes - and comes together in each state capitol on December 8, to count the popular vote and convert it to an electoral count. Each has an equal number of votes as it has members in congress ; for example, CA has 55 because it has 55 members in the house of representatives and 2 members in the Senate. There is a total of 538 electoral votes, and the winning number is 270. A candidate that fails to obtain the electoral votes then has the election decided by the House of Representative, as dictated by the Constitution.

8. Inauguration Day - On January 6, before the joint session of congress, the number of electoral votes are read and recorded. The winner is announced. Two weeks later, on January 20, exactly at noon the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court administers the oath of office to the winner, and at that point that person is is considered to the President of the United States, And let the headache begin!!

IIA- The Electoral college determined who shall be president of the US. Only one candidate ever won all of the electoral votes: George Washington. The Framers created the Electoral college for a variety of reasons, the most important one was that they did not  have a high opinion opinion of the people.

- The Framers considered the population dumb, ignorant, uneducated, ill-informed, slow, simple - minded and easily swayed by a charismatic candidate that could destroy this great country.
- Every few years there is a debate about whether to remove the Electoral college (most often whenever the democrats have lost the election; seen in the 2000 and more recently in the 2016 election). The debate has grown louder in the recent years.
