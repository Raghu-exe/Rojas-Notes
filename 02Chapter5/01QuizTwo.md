    1. It establishes that you are running for office to show who voters can vote for. This way you can garner attention towards yourself as only those who self announced can be able to be voted for in a general election. Trump self announced with a statement of "Make America Great Again" which attracted attention towards his campaign. 
        - People need to know who you are in the first place. This in turn will avail you to donations form supporters and backers. Publicity will get you news coverage and also people will begin to form an opinion about you. The ___ and time of your self announcement is also important; Barack Obama in 2008; Donald Trump in 2015; Kamala Harris in 2019-
    2. This is important as you they are going to be multiple people running for president that are apart of the same political party. Through this you have to win the vote to be able to become a presidential nominee which you need to be in order to attend a national convention. Joe Biden was able to run as a nomination for the democratic party as he was able to beat all other people running for nomination.
    3. Create a clear demonstration of what the president is fighting for. (The party principles and goals known as the party platform). 
    4. You need to go around states and persuade them why they should vote for you. Some states are willing to take a look at your party such as swing states 
    5. Targeted at undecided voters to potentially put down the others party and boost their party's chance at winning
    6. Voters cast ballots to choose the nation's leader
    7. How a president is chosen. If they win the 270 state chosen, they become the president.
    8. President is now sworn into office and is officially president.
