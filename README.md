These will be notes 

All Governments have two major responsibilities/functions: 
- Collect revenue/taxes
- Maintain order
These two functions are symbiotic: meaning one cannot exist without the other 

Some countries have taken one or both functions to the extreme:
Example:- North Korea, Nazi Germany, Commie Union (Soviet Union) - to maintain order, these countries enforced rules and regulations on people - took away the people’s freedoms

Most Americans do not like it when the government imposes any sort of major denial of freedom/rights - they believe they have a right to individual freedoms. They also believe that if the governments creates a rule or regulation that deprives them off their freedoms, they have avenues of redress before inciting or creating REVOLUTION.

 The revolutionary war created a lot of distress and lack of acceptance of the government’s function to exist. Colonists, once freedom was obtained, would want to create a government that would limit its power to tax the people and also not oppress them and take away their freedoms!!!
Colonists also believed that a local government, not a far away government, was the best form of government. Because a local government could understand the people better

 The Declaration of Independence had a major impact on the government. It stipulated that :
The people should be able to exercise their rights!
The people have the right to overthrow their government if it violates their freedom
Unalienable right; they are life liberty and property, And the government should protect these things

## IC

 Many  American believe if the government is not protecting their natural rights, then they have a right to protest. EX: There is a protest is going on to secure rights for black people.
Also, the state government has a major impact on your life, not the federal government. (Despite what the media portrays)

 ## ID

Once Revolutionary war was over, a new government was created to govern the 13 colonies, It was called the Articles of Confederation, it had a short lifespan.
The Articles of Confederation created what is now know as a confederacy. Where all the power was located a local level and not at a federal level. Wanted to avoid another government that was far away from the people, and could protect the people’s rights. The people knew their local government and could also vote to keep or throw their elected officials. This is known as state sovereignty. 

## IIB

---

The Articles of Confederation were going to fail. WHY? It failed to perform the two major functions of government: collect revenue and maintain order!!! (This is at the federal level, not at the state level) IT worked fine at the local level 

Five reason the Articles did not succeed:

1. No Executive branch; no one to enforce the laws passed by Congress
No Judicial branch; disputes between the states were left unresolved.
No power to tax; this meant it could not collect revenue, and not pay any of its debt
No national currency: meant that each state could enact its own currency and this caused massive inflation in the economy
Impossible to amend the Articles of confederation: this meant that the Articles of Confederation would remain stagnant and incapable of making changes to deal with society and the world!!

## II.b.2
 Every state knew that the Articles of Confederation needed revision, but enjoyed the fact that they held the power and not the federal government. So the did not want to make any changes. Would accept the inequities and shortcoming of the Articles of Confederation  

ALL OF THIS CHANGED WITH OME MAJOR IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY:
Shay’s Rebellion: started with poor farmers in the state of Massachusetts, and could have become a major political revolution spreading across the entire 13 states. 

There was no national army to stop a political revolution from spreading across the 13 states. That was because the articles of confederation did not establish an army or executive branch. Many feared that Shay’s rebellion would overthrow the established system, and that it would make the rich become poor, and the rich become poor

Because of Shay’s Rebellion, many leaders across the 13 states realized that the articles of confederation needed to have massive revisions, and they all agreed to meet in Philadelphia in may 1787. This would be the creation of our current government, under the constitution, which is still here today

Lasted from May 25 to September 25, 1787. It replaced the Articles of Confederation. It also is the first time in human history that a peaceful and orderly transfer occurred.

Met in the city of Philadelphia: Why?? Philly cheesesteak sandwiches; and it was also the most central city of all the thirteen states.

## IIIB
 Scrapped the old government and replaced it with a new government which gave more powers to the central government without sacrificing too much of the states power.  The states were not going to give up their prerogative rule within their state. 
Also created a government that lasted over 233 years, and survived numerous growth spurts, and massive changes to American society. Examples include the  Great Depression and the Civil War!

## IIIC
The Framers is the term used to describe the men who wrote the constitution. They had two things in common. They were all men and all were white!!! Some were rich, some were educated in college, some were slaveholders and many of them were chosen by their states to protect state sovereignty. 

Framers came from 12 states; only the state of Rhode Island.  Did not send any delegates, fearing that it was a major conspiracy to take away the people’s freedoms. Total of 55 delegates appeared; only 39 would remain to sign the final document in September.

Controversy: for many years it did not matter that the Framers were white people who owned slaves. This factor was overlooked by the fact that they created an important document that gave people rights and freedoms. However, only in recent years, there has been a movement to discredit the Framers, and also discredit the work they created, which the Constitution. Claim that the  created a nation of injustice based on slavery, and that it has excluded women, African Americans, Native Americans, and anyone who was not white. The current problems in the USA today, these critics claim, come from the fact that the Framers were men and white. Today’s problems of racism, sexism and poverty are the results of the Framers being white males.

IS THIS A FAIR AND ACCURATE STATEMENT?? DOES THE CONSTITUTION PROMOTE THE IDEAS SEEN IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH


## IA

The framers met in the city of Philadelphia, where they gather in the same building that the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence were written. (Also they wanted to go and eat some very good cheesesteaks!!!)

Two major agreements at the first meeting: that the entire convention was to be held in secrecy and that George Washington would be appointed as leader of the convention

The secrecy of the convention was held because the delegates agreed that they were going to    the replace Articles and instead write an entire new document. If the general population knew that the Articles were to be replaced , the state governments would have stopped the convention!!!

On the same day, James Madison introduced to the convention his plan, and since he was from the state of Virginia, It is known as the Virginia Plan.

The Virginia plan entailed many good/great ideas; it had the idea that the central government could be limited in its power by simply stating that any power no written to the national government was reserved for the state government. The plan also stated that the government should be divided into different branches: the Legislative branch, Judicial branch and Executive branch. It also stated that the Legislative branch should be the strongest branch, since this was the only branch that represented the people and the states at the national level. 
The Legislative branch should be bicameral; that is split into two chambers the upper house and a lower house. 
All the delegates saw Madison’s plan had very strong ideas and many were going to approve it; it hit a major impediment when Madison introduced how the legislative branch would be represented!!
The Virginia Plan would have representation to the legislative branch based on population, thereby states greater population would have more votes, and in turn, more power!!

IB-Madison’s plan was anathema to the  smaller states , since these states would not have the same population as the larger states. Therefore, the smaller states asked for a recess and wanted to come up with their own ideas!!!

The small states came up with their own plan, and named it the New Jersey plan, or the Paterson  plan, after its primary author,  William Paterson. The plan stated that each state  would have equally represented in legislative branch, so that the larger states would not take advantage of their larger population and control the legislative branch!It also proposed that the state governments should be weak, and that a supremacy clause be included in the new government, making the national government superior over the state government.

## IC

Well, it is well known that the convention then went into major dispute. The larger states wanted the Virginia plan, the smaller states wanted the New Jersey plan. For almost an entire week the delegates argued back and forth, and at one point the convention nearly ended!!!It took the involvement of George Washington to end the dispute, and this is what he did: he created a committee of 11 members, with 4 members supporting the Virginia Plan, 4 members supporting the New Jersey Plan  , and 3 members who were undecided  . He locked them in a room, told them to work on a compromise, and that they would not come out until they had created a plan!!!
Two days later, the committee had come up with a compromise. It was called then the Connecticut Compromise today we call it the Great Compromise. Here is essential information: FIND THIS INFORMATION OUT FOR YOURSELF USING GOOGLE

Provisions of the Connecticut Compromise (Great Compromise):
1. Bicameral Legislation
2. Everyone gets two representatives in upper house regardless of how big or small the state is
3. Everyone gets representation based on population in lower house (House of representation)

The Great Compromise settled the dispute between large and small states.

Then another major dispute occurred: this was between the southern states and the northern states. The issue at contention: Slavery !!!
How did the issue of slaves and slavery a major area of conflagration at the convention? There was a dispute on how to count the slaves in the national legislature. For the Northern states counting them would deprive them of political power since there were less slaves in the northern states ,In the southern states where the majority of slaves were forced to live and work, it would give them more political power if each slave was counted !!! (This was a major form of oppression, as slaves were not seen or treated as human beings The result would be the 3/5 the Compromise !!! (Look it up and be ready to explain on Friday!!!)

The delegates wanted to fix the problems of the Articles; the five major problems being: No executive branch; no power to tax; no judicial branch, no national currency, no regulation of trade, interstate commerce or international trade. 
For every one of the major problems, the Framers included a solution in the constitution. (Your assignment is to locate specifically in the constitution where is the solution. GET TO IT!!)

1. Executive branch is cited in article 2 section 1 
2. Taxation is cited in Article 1 section 8 clause 2 
3. Judicial branch is cited in Article 3 section 1 
4. Currency is talked about in Article 1 section 8 clause 5
5. Interstate commerce is talked about in Article 1 section 8 clause 3  

## IB

The delegates did not include any of the provisions guaranteeing the right to vote, or promoting equality, or even assurances to the population of women, African Americans, or Native Americans.
It did not even include a Bill of rights , which the delegates believed to be superfluous and not needed in the new government. (One would be added four years later.)
Many believe that the delegates wrote the constitution in this manner so that only  white men could maintain power, and oppress others around them by using the tools of the government. 

## IC

---

After four months, the delegates finished writing the constitution. It was signed by 39 delegates, and it was considered to be enacted on October 17 ,1787.
Now the delegates had to return to their home states and gain the approval of the people in ratifying the new constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation. 

## IIA

In every state, there were those who supported the constitution (called Federalists) and those who opposed the ratification of the Constitution (called Anti Federalists). These groups attempted to convince the people of the states to support their positions regarding the Constitution. In many states it would come down to a small percentage of the population deciding whether or not to ratify the constitution. Famous Federalists include James Madison, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. Famous and vociferous Anti- Federalists included Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. They opposed the Constitution because the new national government would take away too much power from the state and ultimately the people’s rights

## IIB

---

The two states the needed to ratify the constitution were the states of New York and Virginia. The state of  New York was the financial center of the nation and it needed money to start the new nation. The state of Virginia was needed because it had the most population, and that was needed to support the national government with taxes. (Almost every states had already ratified the constitution, with Delaware being the first state!!)

New York- many supported the Constitution after they read the Federalist Papers . Very Persuasive in supporting the Constitution. 
Virginia- George Washington gave his support to the Constitution and this enabled many Virginia voters to ratify the Constitution
The constitution went into affect in the year 1787, and by 1789 all 13 states had ratified the document. 
The Constitution is the oldest government document in the world, having been around for almost 232 years!!

 There are four basic principles of the Constitution. They are: 
	- Separation of Powers
	- Check and balances
	- limited government
	- Federalism

Separation of power highlights how power is distributed in our government. It makes sure that no one person or group in the government holds too much power and infringes on the peoples rights and freedoms.

Checks and balances makes sure that all off he different parts of the government are doing the jobs that they have been given and are not taking part in illegal activites. Because of checks and balances, the American public can rest assured that no one in the different parts of government is taking advantage of their rights and freedom.

The constitution makes sure that the government does not take advantage of the people and infringe on their rights because it clearly outlines the different powers that the government will hold and what they can do with those powers, anything more than that is illegal and unconstitutional

Federalism makes sure that all the states follow similar rules and policies. This makes sure that a state cannot take advantage of its citizens and infringe upon their rights. 

These principles embody the Constitution, as they were written into the Constitution by the Framers to prohibit the federal government from becoming too powerful and taking away the people’s freedom and rights!

The principle that causes the most conflict in politics today is federalism and separation of powers, that is because of the legislative branch system, and also each level of power believes that they have the right to pass the laws it needs for the people. The current conflict of American politics is full of examples of these two principles; Federalism: the federal government does not want to take responsibility and take care of the wildfires that are raging in California

The framers in Article 5 methods on how to amend the Constitution. The process of amending the constitution is a perfect example of federalism , as it requires both the national and  state government coming together to propose and ratify an amendment.

The process is long and sometimes tedious; because of this only 27 additions and 1 retractions to the Constitution has occurred.  (That was the 18 amendment)

Step 1. Passage by Congress. Proposed amendment language must be approved by a two-thirds vote of both houses.
Step 2. Notification of the states. The national archivist sends notification and materials to the governor of each state.
Step 3. Ratification by three-fourths of the states. Ratification of the amendment language adopted by Congress is an up-or-down vote in each legislative chamber. A state legislature cannot change the language. If it does, its ratification is invalid. A governor’s signature on the ratification bill or resolution is not necessary.
Step 4. Tracking state actions. Proposed amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states in order to take effect. Congress may set a time limit for state action. The official count is kept by Office of the Federal Register at the National Archives. Legislatures must return specific materials to show proof of ratification.
Step 5. Announcement. When the requisite number of states ratify a proposed amendment, the archivist of the United States proclaims it as a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Actual certification is published immediately in the Federal Register and eventually in the United States Statutes-at-Large.
State legislatures often call upon Congress to propose constitutional amendments. While these calls may bring some political pressure to bear, Congress is under no constitutional obligation to respond. The U.S. Constitution does not contain a provision requiring Congress to submit a proposed amendment upon request by some requisite number of states.


## IIB

Because amending the Constitution is such a long and tedious procedure, over the past few centuries there has been informal amendments to the Constitution. These have developed over time and lead to massive changes to US government and American society. Example: Supreme Court issues a decision, it will change how the Americans act and conduct business and laws will need to be changed (this past the Supreme Court declared that sexual orientation was protected under federal law)

The Framers argues that a Bill of Rights was not repeated in the Constitution because the government had limited powers. The Framers stated that it was written in the Constitution, that was the function of the national government. If it was not written in the Constitution then the national government could do nothing about it. 
Furthermore, the Framers argues that if they wrote a list of rights and liberties, only those  would be protected; which meant that rights and liberties could be protected by the national government
The Framers eventually gave in to the Anti Federalist demands, and proposed the first ten amendments in 1789. Ratification took place over the next 2 years, until all ten were ratified in 1791!!!

It is a major source of irony that the Bill of Rights were not enacted nor enforced until the 20 Century. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court issued rulings that granted Americans their rights under the Bill of Rights, and when the Supreme Court  made such rulings,It enraged and angered many red blooded Americans, who opposed the Supreme Court!!!
The rights and freedoms under the Bill of Rights have only been in use for the past 60 years!!!

Federalism is a system of government which divides the jurisdiction of a national government and lesser, lower local governments. Federalism creates two governments, each with its own specific jurisdiction, which rarely correlates with each other. The populace has to abide by two distinct laws, one which is national . And the other which is state

## IB

---

The framers created Federalism. They did not specifically write down how it would work, but in the federalist papers stipulated that anything written in the constitution were powers granted to the federal government. These are called enumerated powers
When an enumerated power is related to another power found in the Constitution, or it is believed that they belong to the federal government. They are called inherent powers. An example of this is the president’s powers to create executive agreements with another foreign country, or starting a war with another country
The Federalist papers also stated that anything which is not written in the constitution belongs to the state governments. This is also enforced by the 10th amendment. These powers are called: 

## IA

---

The Framers wrote the Constitution with limited power for the federal government. It stated that these powers were to be called expressed powers because they were written exclusively for the federal government. These powers include the power to tax, or to regulate trade, or to coin money, and to declare . Most of these powers are found in Article 1 , section 8. 
Inherent powers are those which are considered to be national because they are associated with a certain branch of government. EX: Presidents have in the past waged wars because they are the commander in chief. 

## IB

---

Powers not written in the constitution belong to the states. These are called  state powers, reserved powers, or states rights.These laws and powers that the state has influence and control your life the most. EX: laws dealing with education; how fast or slow you can drive; the rate and speed of your internet/wifi-connection; who you can and cannot marry; and at what age you are considered an adult! The state powers are divided into four categories: public health, morals, safety and general welfare.

## IC

---

There are times when the national and state governments will coincide in their jurisdiction of laws. This is called concurrent powers. The national government and state governments have an exact same law, but with different ideas and enforcement. EX: taxes, fines, court system, drug laws.

Federalism in the USA has been around since the ratification of the Constitution. These are two periods of federalism, one that lasted for almost a century and a half, and the other we are currently in. 
 Dual Federalism lasted from	1789 to 1933, and it was how the national government and state governments coexisted. The national government rarely involved itself in state matters, and when it did the national government had to have a major constitution; issue it need to resolve that the states could not. (Sometimes called layer cake federalism, after the type of cake.)

Dual fedaralism ended in 1933 because of the New Deal. 

## IIB

---

Starting with the New Deal programs, and continuing to today, the national government has found ways to interfere with state powers. The national government has given government funding to the states, and this in which the national government can influence and interfere in areas usually reserved for the state governments. (often called marble layer cake , as in the type of cake where there is no separate layers) This is called cooperative federalism, because it is believed that the national government and state governments are cooperating with each other, but in reality the	national government is manipulating the state government to change and do its bidding. 


### IA

- The national government involves itself and is able to achieve its goals and objectives on state issues. It does this by using three major clauses in the Constitution: the ___ to ___: to ___ ____ ____, and the Necessary and Proper clauses.
- These three clauses are major power to the national government: using them allows the national governments to set an agenda that the state governments must follow. This began in 1933 with FDR's new deal programs, and over the decades each President has used these clauses to obtain their agenda over states.
    - EX: LBJ was able to eliminate segregation in the USA; Nixon was able to implement affirmative action; and Obama introduced that hideous, horrible, mind stupefying program called **common core**!!!

### IB

---

- Even with the national government intruding into areas reserved for the states, *the national government offers monetary incentives to make sure its agenda is followed through by the states.*
- The national government offers grants in aids, which are large chunks of federal funds that are offered to the states in return for implementation of national laws and guidelines.
- Two types of grants in aid: block grants and categorical grants. Both come with stipulations and restrictions on how to use the money
- Since many state governments are very much strapped for the funding, they will take the federal government's money and implement the regulations despite the impact it might have on their state.

- Since many states governments are very much strapped for funding, they will take the government's money and implement the regulations despite the effects it might have on their state. EX: Louisiana in 1984, All other states had raised the drinking age to 21, but Louisiana continued at the age of 18. Teens and college students went to Louisiana for the lower drinking age. Louisiana also had terrible roads and highways, which many drivers complained about when travelling across LA. LA asked the national government for funding for their roads and highways; the national government would give them millions of dollars if they increase the drinking age to 21!!! LA raised the drinking age to 21.

- Since 1995, the supreme court has begun to return to the states the power and right to control what is essentially states rights. The supreme court came out with a ruling called U.S. v Lopez stating that the national government overstepped its jurisdiction when it came to punishing a boy who took a gun to school, because schools fall under the state jurisdiction.

### IIIA

---

- The Constitution enables every state to be equal without one state having any power over another state. The Framers wrote this in the Constitution because it wanted all the governments, state and national governments, to be equal.

### IIIB

- Full Faith and Credit clause; any public documents is valid and legally binding in another state. EX: diploma: which will allow you to attend any college across the US!!!.
- Another example is a marriage license. If you are married in one state, you are married in all 50 states!
- This clause prevented states from discriminating against a citizen from another state; it could force that person to go back to school and pay that state's university fees.

### IIC

- Privilege's and immunities clause: any rights that you give to citizens in your state you must also give them to citizens from other states when they are in your state. EX: Nevada: everyone can drink if they are 21 years old: CA and CO: anyone visiting the state can get marijuana without a prescription, but they must partake it here.
- EXCEPTION TO THE RULE: when you apply to universities/colleges; the state can charge you more for being an out of state student.

### IIID

- If you commit a crime in CA, you are caught in another state, CA can request for your extradition.
- The state that has you must return you to CA, unless a pressing or major reason doesn't allow for the transfer.
EX- incomplete paper work, lack of evidence, concern of treatment. This clause was mainly used to return runaway slaves, not criminal suspects. With the increase in technology, and computers extradition is used more frequently in the United States today.
