These will be notes from the worst teacher I have this year

All Governments have two major responsibilities/functions: 
- Collect revenue/taxes
- Maintain order
These two functions are symbiotic: meaning one cannot exist without the other 

Some countries have taken one or both functions to the extreme:
Example:- North Korea, Nazi Germany, Commie Union (Soviet Union) - to maintain order, these countries enforced rules and regulations on people - took away the people’s freedoms

Most Americans do not like it when the government imposes any sort of major denial of freedom/rights - they believe they have a right to individual freedoms. They also believe that if the governments creates a rule or regulation that deprives them off their freedoms, they have avenues of redress before inciting or creating REVOLUTION.  

IA- The revolutionary war created a lot of distress and lack of acceptance of the government’s function to exist. Colonists, once freedom was obtained, would want to create a government that would limit its power to tax the people and also not oppress them and take away their freedoms!!!
Colonists also believed that a local government, not a far away government, was the best form of government. Because a local government could understand the people better 

IB- The Declaration of Independence had a major impact on the government. It stipulated that :
The people should be able to exercise their rights!
The people have the right to overthrow their government if it violates their freedom
Unalienable right; they are life liberty and property, And the government should protect these things

IC- Many  American believe if the government is not protecting their natural rights, then they have a right to protest. EX: There is a protest is going on to secure rights for black people.
Also, the state government has a major impact on your life, not the federal government. (Despite what the media portrays)

IIA- Once Revolutionary war was over, a new government was created to govern the 13 colonies, It was called the Articles of Confederation, it had a short lifespan.
The Articles of Confederation created what is now know as a confederacy. Where all the power was located a local level and not at a federal level. Wanted to avoid another government that was far away from the people, and could protect the people’s rights. The people knew their local government and could also vote to keep or throw their elected officials. This is known as state sovereignty. 

IIB- The Articles of Confederation were going to fail. WHY? It failed to perform the two major functions of government: collect revenue and maintain order!!! (This is at the federal level, not at the state level) IT worked fine at the local level 

Five reason the Articles did not succeed:

1. No Executive branch; no one to enforce the laws passed by Congress
No Judicial branch; disputes between the states were left unresolved.
No power to tax; this meant it could not collect revenue, and not pay any of its debt
No national currency: meant that each state could enact its own currency and this caused massive inflation in the economy
Impossible to amend the Articles of confederation: this meant that the Articles of Confederation would remain stagnant and incapable of making changes to deal with society and the world!!

II.b.2- Every state knew that the Articles of Confederation needed revision, but enjoyed the fact that they held the power and not the federal government. So the did not want to make any changes. Would accept the inequities and shortcoming of the Articles of Confederation  

ALL OF THIS CHANGED WITH OME MAJOR IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY:
Shay’s Rebellion: started with poor farmers in the state of Massachusetts, and could have become a major political revolution spreading across the entire 13 states. 

There was no national army to stop a political revolution from spreading across the 13 states. That was because the articles of confederation did not establish an army or executive branch. Many feared that Shay’s rebellion would overthrow the established system, and that it would make the rich become poor, and the rich become poor

Because of Shay’s Rebellion, many leaders across the 13 states realized that the articles of confederation needed to have massive revisions, and they all agreed to meet in Philadelphia in may 1787. This would be the creation of our current government, under the constitution, which is still here today

Lasted from May 25 to September 25, 1787. It replaced the Articles of Confederation. It also is the first time in human history that a peaceful and orderly transfer occurred.

Met in the city of Philadelphia: Why?? Philly cheesesteak sandwiches; and it was also the most central city of all the thirteen states.

IIIB- Scrapped the old government and replaced it with a new government which gave more powers to the central government without sacrificing too much of the states power.  The states were not going to give up their prerogative rule within their state. 
Also created a government that lasted over 233 years, and survived numerous growth spurts, and massive changes to American society. Examples include the  Great Depression and the Civil War!

IIIC- The Framers is the term used to describe the men who wrote the constitution. They had two things in common. They were all men and all were white!!! Some were rich, some were educated in college, some were slaveholders and many of them were chosen by their states to protect state sovereignty. 

Framers came from 12 states; only the state of Rhode Island.  Did not send any delegates, fearing that it was a major conspiracy to take away the people’s freedoms. Total of 55 delegates appeared; only 39 would remain to sign the final document in September.

Controversy: for many years it did not matter that the Framers were white people who owned slaves. This factor was overlooked by the fact that they created an important document that gave people rights and freedoms. However, only in recent years, there has been a movement to discredit the Framers, and also discredit the work they created, which the Constitution. Claim that the  created a nation of injustice based on slavery, and that it has excluded women, African Americans, Native Americans, and anyone who was not white. The current problems in the USA today, these critics claim, come from the fact that the Framers were men and white. Today’s problems of racism, sexism and poverty are the results of the Framers being white males.

IS THIS A FAIR AND ACCURATE STATEMENT?? DOES THE CONSTITUTION PROMOTE THE IDEAS SEEN IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH

I believe that some part of this statement seems as a fair argument to make. I do believe that the constitution was not written with the rights of African American, Native Americans and women in mind. For example. Slaves were not freed until after the civil war which came several years after the framing of the constitution. Women’s rights or the suffrage movement was also something that came after the creation of the constitution because their rights were not highlighted in it. I also believe that the framers being white males mights have played a big role in the rules that they put forth. They did not want the opposite sex to gain power and any kind of say in politics therefore they didn’t include them in the constitution.  They did not want people of color to have any rights therefore they did not include them in the constitution.  This led to racism because of the inequality between people of color and white people. This also led to sexism because for a long time, women did not enjoy the same rights as men and anyone who wanted to break the mold was looked down upon. Last but not least, this indirectly has led to poverty because people of color have not inherited the same amount of money as white people because their ancestors did not have the same jobs and/or opportunities as white people. This wealth gap has forced several generations to live in very poor conditions.

However, I do not think that the constitution should be discredited along with the framers. The reason behind my thinking is that the constitution dictates many of the important rules that we as citizens have to follow today. Many parts of the constitution as very essential to our day to day lives and if we were to get rid of it, there would be widespread anarchy. The constitution was drafted in such a way that makes it flexible to change. Examples of this have been seen after the end of the civil war when the constitution was amended to give African Americans the right to vote. The constitution was also amended during the women’s suffrage movement in order to give women the right to vote. Therefore it does not make any sense to discredit the constitution as it is a vital part of our daily lives and can always be changed to make sure that everyone is treated equally. 


IA- The framers met in the city of Philadelphia, where they gather in the same building that the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence were written. (Also they wanted to go and eat some very good cheesesteaks!!!)

Two major agreements at the first meeting: that the entire convention was to be held in secrecy and that George Washington would be appointed as leader of the convention

The secrecy of the convention was held because the delegates agreed that they were going to    the replace Articles and instead write an entire new document. If the general population knew that the Articles were to be replaced , the state governments would have stopped the convention!!!

On the same day, James Madison introduced to the convention his plan, and since he was from the state of Virginia, It is known as the Virginia Plan.

The Virginia plan entailed many good/great ideas; it had the idea that the central government could be limited in its power by simply stating that any power no written to the national government was reserved for the state government. The plan also stated that the government should be divided into different branches: the Legislative branch, Judicial branch and Executive branch. It also stated that the Legislative branch should be the strongest branch, since this was the only branch that represented the people and the states at the national level. 
The Legislative branch should be bicameral; that is split into two chambers the upper house and a lower house. 
All the delegates saw Madison’s plan had very strong ideas and many were going to approve it; it hit a major impediment when Madison introduced how the legislative branch would be represented!!
The Virginia Plan would have representation to the legislative branch based on population, thereby states greater population would have more votes, and in turn, more power!!

IB-Madison’s plan was anathema to the  smaller states , since these states would not have the same population as the larger states. Therefore, the smaller states asked for a recess and wanted to come up with their own ideas!!!

The small states came up with their own plan, and named it the New Jersey plan, or the Paterson  plan, after its primary author,  William Paterson. The plan stated that each state  would have equally represented in legislative branch, so that the larger states would not take advantage of their larger population and control the legislative branch!It also proposed that the state governments should be weak, and that a supremacy clause be included in the new government, making the national government superior over the state government.

IC- Well, it is well known that the convention then went into major dispute. The larger states wanted the Virginia plan, the smaller states wanted the New Jersey plan. For almost an entire week the delegates argued back and forth, and at one point the convention nearly ended!!!It took the involvement of George Washington to end the dispute, and this is what he did: he created a committee of 11 members, with 4 members supporting the Virginia Plan, 4 members supporting the New Jersey Plan  , and 3 members who were undecided  . He locked them in a room, told them to work on a compromise, and that they would not come out until they had created a plan!!!
Two days later, the committee had come up with a compromise. It was called then the Connecticut Compromise today we call it the Great Compromise. Here is essential information: FIND THIS INFORMATION OUT FOR YOURSELF USING GOOGLE

Provisions of the Connecticut Compromise (Great Compromise):
1. Bicameral Legislation
2. Everyone gets two representatives in upper house regardless of how big or small the state is
3. Everyone gets representation based on population in lower house (House of representation)

The Great Compromise settled the dispute between large and small states.

Then another major dispute occurred: this was between the southern states and the northern states. The issue at contention: Slavery !!!
How did the issue of slaves and slavery a major area of conflagration at the convention? There was a dispute on how to count the slaves in the national legislature. For the Northern states counting them would deprive them of political power since there were less slaves in the northern states ,In the southern states where the majority of slaves were forced to live and work, it would give them more political power if each slave was counted !!! (This was a major form of oppression, as slaves were not seen or treated as human beings The result would be the 3/5 the Compromise !!! (Look it up and be ready to explain on Friday!!!)


IA- The delegates wanted to fix the problems of the Articles; the five major problems being: No executive branch; no power to tax; no judicial branch, no national currency, no regulation of trade, interstate commerce or international trade. 
For every one of the major problems, the Framers included a solution in the constitution. (Your assignment is to locate specifically in the constitution where is the solution. GET TO IT!!)

1. Executive branch is cited in article 2 section 1 
2. Taxation is cited in Article 1 section 8 clause 2 
3. Judicial branch is cited in Article 3 section 1 
4. Currency is talked about in Article 1 section 8 clause 5
5. Interstate commerce is talked about in Article 1 section 8 clause 3  

IB- The delegates did not include any of the provisions guaranteeing the right to vote, or promoting equality, or even assurances to the population of women, African Americans, or Native Americans.
It did not even include a Bill of rights , which the delegates believed to be superfluous and not needed in the new government. (One would be added four years later.)
Many believe that the delegates wrote the constitution in this manner so that only  white men could maintain power, and oppress others around them by using the tools of the government. 

IC- After four months, the delegates finished writing the constitution. It was signed by 39 delegates, and it was considered to be enacted on October 17 ,1787.
Now the delegates had to return to their home states and gain the approval of the people in ratifying the new constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation. 

IIA- In every state, there were those who supported the constitution (called Federalists) and those who opposed the ratification of the Constitution (called Anti Federalists). These groups attempted to convince the people of the states to support their positions regarding the Constitution. In many states it would come down to a small percentage of the population deciding whether or not to ratify the constitution. Famous Federalists include James Madison, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. Famous and vociferous Anti- Federalists included Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry. They opposed the Constitution because the new national government would take away too much power from the state and ultimately the people’s rights

IIB- The two states the needed to ratify the constitution were the states of New York and Virginia. The state of  New York was the financial center of the nation and it needed money to start the new nation. The state of Virginia was needed because it had the most population, and that was needed to support the national government with taxes. (Almost every states had already ratified the constitution, with Delaware being the first state!!)

New York- many supported the Constitution after they read the Federalist Papers . Very Persuasive in supporting the Constitution. 
Virginia- George Washington gave his support to the Constitution and this enabled many Virginia voters to ratify the Constitution
The constitution went into affect in the year 1787, and by 1789 all 13 states had ratified the document. 
The Constitution is the oldest government document in the world, having been around for almost 232 years!!


Notes After the First Quiz

 IA- There are four basic principles of the Constitution. They are: 
	- Separation of Powers
	- Check and balances
	- limited government
	- Federalism

Separation of power highlights how power is distributed in our government. It makes sure that no one person or group in the government holds too much power and infringes on the peoples rights and freedoms.

Checks and balances makes sure that all off he different parts of the government are doing the jobs that they have been given and are not taking part in illegal activites. Because of checks and balances, the American public can rest assured that no one in the different parts of government is taking advantage of their rights and freedom.

The constitution makes sure that the government does not take advantage of the people and infringe on their rights because it clearly outlines the different powers that the government will hold and what they can do with those powers, anything more than that is illegal and unconstitutional

Federalism makes sure that all the states follow similar rules and policies. This makes sure that a state cannot take advantage of its citizens and infringe upon their rights. 

These principles embody the Constitution, as they were written into the Constitution by the Framers to prohibit the federal government from becoming too powerful and taking away the people’s freedom and rights!
 
IB- The principle that causes the most conflict in politics today is federalism and separation of powers, that is because of the legislative branch system, and also each level of power believes that they have the right to pass the laws it needs for the people. The current conflict of American politics is full of examples of these two principles; Federalism: the federal government does not want to take responsibility and take care of the wildfires that are raging in California

IIA- The framers in Article 5 methods on how to amend the Constitution. The process of amending the constitution is a perfect example of federalism , as it requires both the national and  state government coming together to propose and ratify an amendment.

The process is long and sometimes tedious; because of this only 27 additions and 1 retractions to the Constitution has occurred.  (That was the 18 amendment)

Step 1. Passage by Congress. Proposed amendment language must be approved by a two-thirds vote of both houses.
Step 2. Notification of the states. The national archivist sends notification and materials to the governor of each state.
Step 3. Ratification by three-fourths of the states. Ratification of the amendment language adopted by Congress is an up-or-down vote in each legislative chamber. A state legislature cannot change the language. If it does, its ratification is invalid. A governor’s signature on the ratification bill or resolution is not necessary.
Step 4. Tracking state actions. Proposed amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states in order to take effect. Congress may set a time limit for state action. The official count is kept by Office of the Federal Register at the National Archives. Legislatures must return specific materials to show proof of ratification.
Step 5. Announcement. When the requisite number of states ratify a proposed amendment, the archivist of the United States proclaims it as a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Actual certification is published immediately in the Federal Register and eventually in the United States Statutes-at-Large.
State legislatures often call upon Congress to propose constitutional amendments. While these calls may bring some political pressure to bear, Congress is under no constitutional obligation to respond. The U.S. Constitution does not contain a provision requiring Congress to submit a proposed amendment upon request by some requisite number of states.


IIB- Because amending the Constitution is such a long and tedious procedure, over the past few centuries there has been informal amendments to the Constitution. These have developed over time and lead to massive changes to US government and American society. Example: Supreme Court issues a decision, it will change how the Americans act and conduct business and laws will need to be changed (this past the Supreme Court declared that sexual orientation was protected under federal law)

IA- The Bill of Rights were written to appease the Anti-Federalists who claimed that the Constitution gave the Federal government too much power, power which could be used to take away the people’s rights and freedoms.
The Bill of Rights place restriction on which rights and liberties the government cannot remove or abolish. 

The Bill of Rights are as follows:
											Amendment 1 								- Freedom of Religion, Speech, and the Press
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

											Amendment 2 										- The Right to Bear Arms
A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.

											Amendment 3 										- The Housing of Soldiers

Amendment 5 - Protection of Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property
No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.

Amendment 6 - Rights of Accused Persons in Criminal Cases
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.

Amendment 7 - Rights in Civil Cases

Amendment 8 - Excessive Bail, Fines, and Punishments Forbidden
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

Amendment 9 - Other Rights Kept by the People
The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Amendment 10 - Undelegated Powers Kept by the States and the People
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.


IB- The Framers argues that a Bill of Rights was not repeated in the Constitution because the government had limited powers. The Framers stated that it was written in the Constitution, that was the function of the national government. If it was not written in the Constitution then the national government could do nothing about it. 
Furthermore, the Framers argues that if they wrote a list of rights and liberties, only those  would be protected; which meant that rights and liberties could be protected by the national government
The Framers eventually gave in to the Anti Federalist demands, and proposed the first ten amendments in 1789. Ratification took place over the next 2 years, until all ten were ratified in 1791!!!

IIIC- It is a major source of irony that the Bill of Rights were not enacted nor enforced until the 20 Century. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court issued rulings that granted Americans their rights under the Bill of Rights, and when the Supreme Court  made such rulings,It enraged and angered many red blooded Americans, who opposed the Supreme Court!!!
The rights and freedoms under the Bill of Rights have only been in use for the past 60 years!!!

IIA- The other amendments 11 to 27!!!
Political scientists and teachers categorize the next 16 amendments into one of three categories. They are:

1. Reforming or fixing government errors :
	- Amendments #: 11, 12, 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27
2. Promoting equality or freedoms/rights:
	-Amendments #: 13, 14, 15, 19, 23 ,24, 26
3. Imposing morality on the American people:
	- Amendment # - 18 , 21.   (Twin Amendments)

All of the amendments
 
Amendment 1. The freedom of religion, speech, and to peacefully assemble together. 
Amendment 2. The right to own a gun. 
Amendment 3. The right to not house a solider. 
Amendment 4. The right to not be searched or have something taken away within reason. 
Amendment 5. The right to life, liberty, property, and no double jeopardy or self-incrimination.
Amendment 6. The right to a speedy trial, public trial, and with a jury of your peers. 
Amendment 7. The right to a jury trial in a civil case. 
Amendment 8. Protection from excessive bail, and cruel and unusual punishments. 
Amendment 9. The rights not listed in the Constitution. 
Amendment 10. Any rights not given to the federal government are given to the states.
Amendment 11. Protects the states from law suits. 
Amendment 12. There are separate ballets for the President and Vice President.
Amendment 13. The abolishment of slavery.
Amendment 14. Equal protection under the Constitution for all United States citizens. 
Amendment 15. No voting discrimination of race.
Amendment 16. Income tax is legal. 
Amendment 17. Popular vote for United States Senate.
Amendment 18. Prohibition of alcohol.
Amendment 19. Women's right to vote.
Amendment 20. Moving of dates for terms of presidency. 
Amendment 21. Repeal of prohibition of alcohol.
Amendment 22. Limits the terms Presidents can serve.

Amendment 25. The succession for presidency shall something happen to the President.  
Amendment 26. The minimum voting age is 18.
Amendment 27. Congress cannot get a pay raise until the next term. 


The following 16 amendments were ratified to fix a problem in the Constitution or American government, or to provide freedoms and rights to the people. However, only a total of 27 amendments have been ratified. This indicates that the Framers did not want the American people to create drastic changes to the Constitution.


Notes After the 2nd Quiz:

IA- Federalism is a system of government which divides the jurisdiction of a national government and lesser, lower local governments. Federalism creates two governments, each with its own specific jurisdiction, which rarely correlates with each other. The populace has to abide by two distinct laws, one which is national . And the other which is state

IB- The framers created Federalism. They did not specifically write down how it would work, but in the federalist papers stipulated that anything written in the constitution were powers granted to the federal government. These are called enumerated powers
When an enumerated power is related to another power found in the Constitution, or it is believed that they belong to the federal government. They are called inherent powers. An example of this is the president’s powers to create executive agreements with another foreign country, or starting a war with another country
The Federalist papers also stated that anything which is not written in the constitution belongs to the state governments. This is also enforced by the 10th amendment. These powers are called:
