### Virginia Plan

---

- The secrecy of the convention was held because the delegates agreed that they were going to revise the Articles of confederation and abolish it.
- On the same day James Madison introduced to the convention his plan, and since he was from the state of Virginia, it is known as the **Virginian plan.**
- **Madison** introduced that the National government should be divided into three branches: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. It also stated that the legislative branch should be the strongest.
- The legislative branch should be bicameral, that is split into two branches; and upper house and a lower house.
- All the people saw that Madison's plan had very strong ideas and many were going to approve it; it hit a major impediment when Madison introduced how the legislative branch would be counted!!
- Madison's plan was anathema to the smaller states, since these states would not have a larger population. The smaller states asked for a recess.

### Patterson Plan

---

- The constitutional convention came up with their own plan, and named the it the **New Jersey Plan**, or the **patterson plan**, after its primary author, **William Patterson.** *The plan stated that each state would have its own representation in the legislative branch, so that the larger states would not take advantage of their larger population and control the legislative branch.* It also proposed that the executive branch should be weak, and that a supremacy clause be included in the government, making the larger states superior over the smaller states.
- Larger states disliked this as it removed their large population power

### George Washington and the Connecticut Compromise

---

- Searching for a new plan where there is a balance between larger and smaller states
- For almost an entire week the delegates argued back and forth, and at one point the convention nearly ended! It took the involvement of George Washington to end the dispute. He created a committee of 11 members, with He locked them in a room, told them to work on a compromise, and they would not come out until they had created a compromise.
- Two days later,  the committee came up with a compromise. It was called then the **connecticut compromis**e, but today we call it the great compromise.
- **Connecticut compromise**: *The compromise that provided for a bicameral federal legislature that used a dual system of representation: the upper house would have equal representation from each state, while the lower house would have proportional representation based on a state's population.*
- The federal government was created: the debate over the legislative branch was resolved by giving one house , and the other house representation based on the number of people in each state.
- The connecticut compromise settled the dispute between large and small states.
- Then another major dispute occurred: this was between the Northern States and the Southern states. The issue at contention: Slavery!!!
- How did the issues of slaves and slavery a major area of conflagration at the convention?
- There was a dispute on how to count the slaves in the legislature. For the northern states counting them would deprive them of political power since there were no slaves in the Northern States
- In the southern states, where the majority of slaves were forced to live and work, it would give them more political power if each slave was counted!!!
