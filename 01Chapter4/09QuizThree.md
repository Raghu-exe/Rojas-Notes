### IA

---

- The Framers wrote the Constitution with limited powers for the national government. It stated that these powers were to be called expressed powers, because they were written specifically for the federal government.
- These powers include the power to tax, or to regulate trade, or to print money, and to declare war.
- Most of these powers are found in Article 1, section 8.
- Inherent powers are those which are considered to be national because they are associated with a certain branch of government. Ex: Presidents have in the past used military because they are the commander in chief.

### IB

---

- Powers were not written in the constitution belong to the state. These are called state powers or reserved powers.
- The laws and powers that the state has influence and control your life the most. EX: laws dealing with education; how fast or how slow you can drive; the rate and speed of your internet/WI-FI;
- Who you can and cannot marry; and at what age you are considered to be an adult!
- The state powers are divided into four categories: public health, morals, safety and welfare.

### IC

---

- There are times when the national and state governments will coincide in their jurisdiction of laws. This is called concurrent powers.
- The national government and state governments have an exact same law, but with different ideas and enforcement. EX: taxes; fines; court system; drug laws

### IIA

---

- Federalism in the USA has been around since the ratification of the Constitution. There are two periods of federalism, one that lasted for almost a century and half; and the other we are currently in.
- Dual federalism lasted from 1789 to 1901, and it was how the national government and state governments coexisted.
- The national government rarely involved itself in state matters, and when it did the national government had to have a major constitutional issue it needed to resolve that the states could not (*Sometimes called layer cake federalism, after the type of cake).*
- Dual federalism ended in 1901 because of the **New Deal**

### IIB

---

- Starting with the **New Deal programs,** and continuing to today, the national government has found ways to interfere with state powers.
- The national government has given economic stability to the states, and this is the way in which the national government can influence and interfere in areas usually reserved for the state governments. (often called marble layer cake, as in the type of cake where there is no separate layers)
- This is called cooperative federalism, because it believed that the national government and state governments are cooperating with each other, but in reality the national government is manipulating the state governments to change and do its bidding
