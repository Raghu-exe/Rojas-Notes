### Framers argument

---

- The Framers argued that a Bill of Rights was not needed in the Constitution because the government had limited powers.
- The Framers stated that if it was written in the Constitution, that was the function of the national government. *The Framers stated that if it was not written in the Constitution, the national government could do nothing about it.*
- Furthermore, the Framers argued that if they wrote a list of rights and liberties, only those written would be protected; which meant that their rights and liberties could be controlled by the national government.
- The Framers eventually gave in to the anti-federalists demands, and proposed the first ten amendments in 1789. Ratification took place over the next 2 years, until all ten were ratified in December 15th 1871!!!

### Enacted/Enforced

---

- It is a major source of irony that the Bill of Rights were not enacted nor enforces until the 20th century. In the 1960s, the supreme court issued rulings that granted Americans their rights under the Bill of Rights, and when the supreme court made such ruling, it enraged and angered many red blooded Americans, who opposed the supreme court.
- The rights and freedoms under the Bill of Rights have only been in use for the past 60 years!!!

### Amendments 11 - 27

---

- Reforming or fixing government errors:
    1. Amendment 11
    2. Amendment 12 (Separate election of the president and vice president by the elector college)
    3. Amendment 16 (Permitted Congress to levy an income tax)
    4. Amendment 17 (American voters allowed to directly elect US senators)
    5. Amendment 20 (Congress must assemble at least once a year)
    6. Amendment 22 (Limit term of president to two terms

- Promoting equality or freedom/rights:
    1. Amendment 13 (Abolishment of slavery)
    2. Amendment 14 (Full rights of citizenship are given to everyone born in US except American Indians)
    3. Amendment 15 (Guaranteed voting rights regardless of race)
    4. Amendment 19 (Granted women the right to vote 1920)
    5. Amendment 23 (Right of voting citizens in Washington D.C. and that they get votes in the electoral college)
    6. Amendment 24 (Prohibits poll tax in federal elections)
    7. 

- Imposing morality on the American people:
    1. Amendment 18 (Prohibited the manufacture, sale, and distribution of alcoholic beverages)
    2. Amendment 21 (Repealed prohibition)

- The following 16 amendments were ratified to fix a problem in the Constitution or American government, or to provide freedom and rights to the people. However, only a total of 27 amendments have ratified.
- This indicates that the Framers did not want the American people to make drastic changes to the Constitution.
