*9/1/2020*

- Central government = Far away government
- **Declaration of independence**
    1. People should be able to pick their government
    2. The people should have the right to overthrow their government if it violates their rights
    3. People have their **natural rights**; *they are life, liberty, and property!* And the government must protect these rights
- Many Americans believe if the government is not protecting their natural rights, then they should have the right to over throw it

*Example: Black Lives matter movement*

- The local government has a major impact on your life, not the national government

### Revolutionary War

---

- *Once Revolutionary war was over, a new government was created to govern the 13 colonies. It was called the articles of confederation and it had a short lifespan.*
- The **articles of confederation** created what is now known as a confederation that is located at a local level
- State sovereignty is the ability to protect people in the states
- The articles of confederation failed at the national level as it failed to maintain order and have taxes (the local government was fine)
- Failure of articles of confederation:
    1. No executive branch: no one to enforce the laws passed by Congress
    2. No judicial branch: disputes between the states were left unresolved
    3. No power to tax; no ability to collect taxes and not pay off its debt
    4. No national bank: meant that each state could make its own money, and this caused massive inflation in the economy
    5. No national currency
    6. No trading
    7. Impossible to amend articles of confederation: this meant that the articles of confederation would remain stagnant and incapable of making changes to deal with society and end the world (required all 13 states)
- The failures are solved when they rewrite the constitution

### Beginning of Constitution

---

- Every state knew that the articles of confederation needed revisions, but enjoyed the the fact that they held the power and not the national government
- **Shays rebellion** could have become a major problematic protest, spreading across the entire united states
- There was no national government to stop a farmer's rebellion from spreading across the 13 states. That was because the articles of confederation did not establish an army, or an executive branch
    - Many feared the rebellion as it would overthrow the established system of the rich being rich
- *13 states met at the constitutional convention in philladelphia to create the constitution which is still widely used today*
