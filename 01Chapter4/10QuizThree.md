- The national government involves itself and is able to achieve its goals and objectives on state issues. It does this by using three major clauses in the Constitution: the ____ to ___: to ___ ____ ____, and the Necessary and Proper clauses.
- These three clauses are major power to the national government: using them allows the national governments to set an agenda that the state governments must follow. This began in 1933 with FDR's new deal programs, and over the decades each President has used the clauses to obtain their agenda over states.
    - EX: LBJ was able to eliminate segregation in the USA; Nixon was able to implement affirmative action; and Obama introduced that hideous, horrible, mind stupefying program called **common core**!!!

- Even with the national government intruding into areas reserved for the states, *the national government offers monetary incentives to make sure its agenda is followed through by the states.*
- The national government offers grants and aids, which are large chunks of federal funds that are offered to the states in return for implementation of national laws and guidelines.
- Two types of grant names: block grants and categorical grants. Both come with stipulations and restrictions on how to use the money
- Since many state governments are very much strapped for the funding, they will take the federal government's money and implement the regulations despite the impact it might have on their state.
- EX: Louisiana in 1984, All other states had raised the drinking age to 21, but LA continued at the age of 18. Teens and college students went to LA for the lower drinking age. LA also had terrible roads and highways, which many drivers complained about when travelling across LA. LA asked the national government for funding for their roads and highways; the national government would give them millions of dollars if they increase the voting age to 21!!! LA raised the voting age to 21.

- Since 1995, the supreme court has begun to return to the states the power and right to control what is essentially states rights. The supreme court came out with a ruling called U.S. v Lopez stating that the national government overstepped its jurisdiction when it came to punishing a boy who took a gun to school, because schools fall under the state jurisdiction.

### IIIA

---

- The Constitution enables every state to be equal without one state having any power over another state. The Framers wrote this in the Constitution because it wanted all the governments, state and national governments, to be equal.

### IIIB

---

- Full Faith and Credit clause; any public documents is valid and legally binding in another state. EX: diploma: which will allow you to attend any college across the US!!!.
- Another example is a marriage license. If you are married in one state, you are married in all 50 states!
- This clause prevented states from discriminating against a citizen from another state; it could force that person to go back to school and pay that state's university fees.

### IIC

- Privilege's and immunities clause: any rights that you give to citizens in your state you must also give them to citizens from other states when they are in your state. EX: Nevada: everyone can drink if they are 21 years old: CA and CO: anyone visiting the state can get marijuana without a prescription, but they must partake it here.
- EXCEPTION TO THE RULE: when you apply to universities/colleges; the state can charge you more for being an out of state student.

### IIID

- If you commit a crime in CA, you are caught in another state, CA can request for your presence.
- The state that has you must return you to CA, unless a pressing or major reason doesn't allow for the transfer.
