- All governments perform two essential functions:
    - Collect taxes
    - Maintain order
- These two functions are symbiotic to each other
    - They need money to maintain order
    - You need order to maintain money from taxes
    - *Example: Fremont School District is a local government as they maintain order through having us go to school on certain hours and have us listen to the admins and teacher. ADA (average daily attendance) everyday a student shows up to school we get money*
- Every government tends to go to the extremes with the above functions
    - *North Korea having men join the army*
    - *North Korea has curfews*
    - *All the same hair cut*
- Only one country does not go to the extreme with the above function
    - America
    - The constitution places freedom over order and taxes
    - Furthermore most, if not all, Americans have a firm belief or support for the constitution
