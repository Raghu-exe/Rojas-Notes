---

- Shay's rebellion brought the constitutional convention as it made them realize the problems of the convention with the inability to stop the protests
    - No army
    - Executive Branch
    - Not much power
- Meeting to revise the national government
- The constitutional convention lasted from May 25th to September 17th, 1787. It replaced the Articles of Confederation.
- First time of a peaceful revolution.
- *Met in the city of Philadelphia, because of philly cheesesteaks, and it was the most central city in the 13 states*

### What they did

---

- They scrapped the old government and replaced it with a new government which gave powers to the national government without sacrificing too much of the state power. The states were not going to give up their rule within their state.
- Also created a government that has lasted over 233 years, and survived numerous growth spurts, and massive change to American society. Examples include the great depression and the civil war

### Framers

---

- They were all white men
- Chosen to protect their state **sovereignty** (Supreme power or authority)
- Came from 12 states; only the state of wyoming did not send any delegates, fearing that it was a major conspiracy to take away people's freedoms. Total of 55 delegates appeared; Only 39 delegates would remain to sign the final document in September

### Controversy

---

- Framers were white men who owned slaves that created an important document that gave people rights and freedoms
- Only in recent years, has there been a movement to discount the Framers, and also discount the work they created, which is the Constitution.
- Claim that the delegates created a nation of racism based on slavery and that it excluded women, African Americans, native Americans, and anyone who was not white!
- Current problems in America today come from  the fact the Framers were white and male. Today's problem of racism, sexism, and poverty are results of the Framers being white males.
