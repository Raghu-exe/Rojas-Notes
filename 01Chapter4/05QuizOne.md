IA. The delegates wanted to fix the problems of the articles:

No executive branch; no power to tax; no judicial branch; no national currency; no regulation of trade, interstate or international trade.

### Framers fix problems in constitution

---

Article 2 established the executive branch where the president approves and carries out the laws created by the legislative branch. Section 1 is where they state the president will have this executive power.

Article 1 established Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes to pay debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States

Article 3 establishes the judicial branch where it is empowered to handle cases or controversies arising under federal law

Article 1 section 8 gives congress the power to "coin money and regulate the value" of both U.S and foreign coins, and regulate interstate commerce. 

### Delegates did not include

---

- The delegates did not include any provisions guaranteeing the right to vote, or promoting equality, or even assurances to the population women, African Americans, or Native Americans
- It did not even include bill of rights, which the delegates believed to be superfluous and not needed in the government
- Many believe that the delegates wrote the Constitution in this manner so that only white men could maintain power, and oppress others around them by using the tools of government

### Writing the constitution

---

- After four months, the delegates finished writing the constitution. It was signed by 39 delegates, and it was considered to be enacted on 1788
- Now the delegates had to return to their home states and gain the approval of the people and ratify the new Constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation.

### Federalists vs Anti-Federalists

- In every state, there were those who supported the Constitution (called federalists) and those who opposed ratification of the Constitution (called antifederalists)
- Each group needed the population to to decide whether or not to ratify the Constitution
- Famous Federalists include George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison. Famous loud Anti-Federalists included Thomas Jefferson and Samuel Adams
- *The Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution because the new national government would take away too much power from the States, and ultimately the people's rights.*

### Dire need of these States to win

---

- The two states that were needed to ratify the Constitution were the states of New York and Virginia
- The state of New York was the financial center of the nation, and it needed the money to start the new nation.
- The state of Virginia was needed because it had the most population, and that was needed to support the national government with taxes. (Almost every state had already ratified the Constitution, with Delaware being the first state!!!)

### Misc

---

- New York - many supported the Constitution after they read the federal's papers which were very persuasive in supporting the Constitution
- Virginia - George Washington gave his support to the Constitution, and this enabled many Virginia voters to Ratify the Constitution.
- The constitution went into effect in the year 1788, and by 1789 all 13 states had ratified the document
- The Constitution is the oldest document in the world, having been around for almost 233 years!!!
